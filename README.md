## Brodelo App

The inspiration for this project is based on the idea of my buddies and I meeting up at our local breweries and connecting, having a good time, venting, and creating a brotherhood. The name "Brodelo" is also a spin on the infamous mexican Pilsner-style Lager, emphasizing the importance of male bonding.

### Future Features

Currently, the app takes in breweriy data from the free and open-source dataset, [Open Brewery DB](openbrewerydb.org). In addition to the dataset provided, it has the ability to add additional breweries based on user findings.

The goal is also to have our user feature implement things like favoriting breweries, in case one wants to keep it on their list of go-to breweries. I'd also like to implement some sort of social feature to foster connection.
